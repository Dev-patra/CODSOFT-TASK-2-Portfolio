            <h1>About <img src="assets/about.png" alt=""></h1>
            <div>Hello! I'm an enthusiastic front-end developer in my final year of pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer
                Applications (BCA). With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm passionate about crafting
                intuitive and visually appealing user experiences. I believe in the power of clean, efficient code and a
                user-first approach to design.
            </div>

                <div>My journey in web development has been enriched by continuous learning and hands-on projects. I am
                    currently diving deep into React.js and Angular, which have expanded my ability to build dynamic,
                    high-performance applications. These frameworks allow me to create responsive, interactive web
                    applications that provide seamless user experiences.

                </div>

                <div>One of my major undertakings is developing a fully functioning college website. This project has
                    been a fantastic opportunity to explore new technologies, improve my problem-solving skills, and
                    implement best practices in web development. It has also taught me the importance of collaboration,
                    as working with a team to bring this project to life has been both challenging and rewarding.

                </div>

                <div>As a fresher in the front-end development field, I am eager to bring my enthusiasm, creativity, and
                    technical skills to real-world projects. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always
                    looking to learn from others while contributing my unique perspective. My goal is to create web
                    experiences that are not only functional but also delightful to use.

            <h2> Projects That Showcase My Skills:</h2>

            <h3>Spotify Clone: </h3>Developed a fully functional clone of Spotify, complete with user
            authentication, playlist management, and seamless music playback. This project honed my skills in
            responsive design and API integration.

            <h3>Netflix Clone:</h3> Built a Netflix clone featuring dynamic content rendering, user profiles, and a
            smooth, user-friendly interface. This project allowed me to delve deep into the world of single-page
            applications and state management.

            <h3>Calculator:</h3> Created a simple yet elegant calculator with basic arithmetic functions and an
            intuitive UI. This project was a great exercise in understanding event handling and DOM manipulation.

            <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game:</h3> Designed a fun and interactive tic-tac-toe game that can be played against
            the computer or another player. This project enhanced my knowledge of game logic and AI implementation.

            <h3>Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:</h3> Developed a classic rock-paper-scissors game with a clean design and
            smooth animations. This project was a perfect way to practice CSS animations and user interaction.

            <h3>College Website:</h3> Currently working on a major project to develop a fully functioning college
            website. This involves learning and exploring many new technologies and methodologies to ensure a
            robust, user-friendly platform.

            In addition to these projects, I'm actively continuing my education in modern front-end frameworks,
            focusing on React.js and Angular. This ongoing learning helps me stay at the cutting edge of web
            development and enhances my ability to build dynamic, high-performance applications.

            As a fresher in the front-end development field, I am eager to leverage my skills in real-world
            applications. My projects reflect my commitment to quality and my ability to adapt to new technologies
            quickly. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always looking to learn and grow with new
            challenges.
